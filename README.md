 # JS Basics Learning Project

## Overview
This is a simple JavaScript project to practice basic concepts like console output. It's designed for beginners to get hands-on experience with JavaScript in a web environment.

## Features
- A basic HTML file (`index.html`) to host the JavaScript.
- A JavaScript file (`index.js`) that logs messages to the console.

## Getting Started
1. **Prerequisites**: Make sure you have a code editor (like VS Code) and a web browser installed.
2. **Installation**: No additional dependencies needed—just clone or open this project in your editor.
3. **Running the Project**:
   - Open `index.html` in your web browser.
   - Check the browser's console (usually via right-click > Inspect > Console) to see the output from `index.js`.

## Learning Points
- This project demonstrates how to use `console.log()` for debugging and output—it's a fundamental tool for testing code as you learn.
- As you expand, consider adding more files or features, like user interactions in HTML.

## Contributing
Feel free to modify this project as you learn. If you're adding new features, remember to update this README to keep track of changes!
